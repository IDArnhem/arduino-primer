Touchscreens, touchpads and the Kinect have changed this perception a little but it remains largely the same.

### Kinect
![Skeletal tracking](http://res.cloudinary.com/zilogtastic/image/upload/v1505408570/kinect4_wnlfpb.png)

The Kinect introduced skeletal tracking for full-body interactions but as you can see the image that the computer has of the human is still **reductionist** at best.

# Arduino: a primer

I'm sure you have heard about this Arduino thing.
---
## Arduino
#### is a platform to program microcontrollers
(think of it as a wee little computer if you will)
---
## A microcontroller
(your washing machine has one)

Note:
microcontrollers far exceed the number of computers in the world and they have been around for a very long time

## Sensing the world around you
sensors and what they do
---
## What is a sensor?
A sensor is an electronic device that can transform a physical property of our world into an electrical signal that a computer can understand.

The only thing that you need to know about a sensor for now is that it is "a value that moves through time". People in finance call that a "ticker" in EE it's called a "signal" in electronic music they call it a "control signal" but in all of them they mean "a value that moves through time".
---
## There are (for now) two types of sensors
We can classify them according to the kind of signal that they produce:
  - digital (two states)
    - shit happened (HIGH = 1)
    - shit didn't happen (LOW = 0)
  - analog
    - how much of the actual shit happened
    - it is often a number between 0 and 1024

### If you have a cheap Arduino clone, get the driver
[CH340G serial driver install](https://kig.re/2014/12/31/how-to-use-arduino-nano-mini-pro-with-CH340G-on-mac-osx-yosemite.html)
+++
### Download and install the software (IDE)
[get a recent version, greater than 1.8](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
+++
### What's in the IDE?
+++
### Mac only
###### If you have problems: disable System Integrity Protection (SIP)
[Disable SIP](https://tzapu.com/making-ch340-ch341-serial-adapters-work-under-el-capitan-os-x/)
