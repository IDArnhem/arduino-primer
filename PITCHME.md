Note:
open your calculator app in your phone, calculate something (anything) Didn't that feel a little glassy?

### the "pictures through glass" paradigm
is far older than the touchscreen of our phones

### how the computer sees you

Touchscreens, touchpads and Kinect have changed this perception a little but it remains largely the same.

### Kinect
![Skeletal tracking](http://res.cloudinary.com/zilogtastic/image/upload/v1505408570/kinect4_wnlfpb.png)


The Kinect introduced skeletal tracking for full-body interactions but as you can see the image that the computer has of the human is still **reductionist** at best.

# Arduino: a primer
---
I'm sure you have heard about this Arduino thing.
---
## Arduino is a microcontroller
(think of it as a wee little computer if you will)
---
## A microcontroller
(your washing machine has one)

notes: microcontrollers far exceed the number of computers in the world and they have been around for a very long time

## Sensing the world around you
sensors and what they do
---
## What is a sensor?
A sensor is an electronic device that can transform a physical property of our world into an electrical signal that a computer can understand.

In effect, the only thing that you ever need to know about a sensor is that it is "a value that moves through time". People in finance call that a "ticker" in EE it's called a "signal" in electronic music they call it a "control signal" but in all of them they mean "a value that moves through time".
---
## There are (for now) two types of sensors
We can classify them according to the kind of signal that they produce:
  - digital (two states)
    - shit happened (HIGH = 1)
    - shit didn't happen (LOW = 0)
  - analog
    - how much of the actual shit happened
    - it is often a number between 0 and 1024
