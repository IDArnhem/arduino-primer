## we are in the "pictures through glass" age of interaction

notes: open your calculator app in your phone, calculate something (anything) Didn't that feel a little glassy?

## the "pictures through glass" paradigm
is far older than the touchscreen of our phones

### how the computer sees you

Touchscreens, touchpads and Kinect have changed this perception a little but it remains largely the same.

### Kinect

The Kinect introduced skeletal tracking for full-body interactions but as you can see the image that the computer has of the human is still **reductionist** at best.

electronics let us bridge the gap between the digital domain and the physical world

## Arduino: a primer
---
I'm sure you have heard about this Arduino thing.
---
Arduino is a microcontroller
(think of it as a wee little computer if you will)
---
## A microcontroller
(your washing machine has one)

notes: microcontrollers far exceed the number of computers in the world and they have been around for a very long time
---
## Sensing the world around you
sensors and what they do
---
## What is a sensor?
A sensor is an electronic device that can transform a physical property of our world into an electrical signal that a computer can understand.

In effect, the only thing that you ever need to know about a sensor is that it is "a number that moves through time".
---
## There are (for now) two types of sensors
We can classify them according to the kind of signal that they produce:
  - digital (two states)
    - shit happened (HIGH = 1)
    - shit didn't happen (LOW = 0)
  - analog
    - how much of the actual shit happened
    - it is often a number between 0 and 1024
